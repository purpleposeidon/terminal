A sweet-tongued terminal manipulation library

It's an alternative to programming with curses.



Should You Use it?
  When to use:
    When you think using curses is a pain in the ...bum
    When you just want color/attributes, without dealing with the accursed curses
    When you find using said accurs√©d to be a pain in the tushie
    When you want to use multiple terminal windows
    When you need to do terminal-manipulations on files other than stdout
    When you want unicode (If unicode is all you want, consider also py3k, which supports unicode with curses)
    When you think that curses' input system leaves something to be desired
    When you trust the terminal package to let you see tracebacks AND keep your terminal sane
  
  When not to use:
    When you have got to support non-typical terminals (I think konsole is typical)
    When you want to have sub-windows in a terminal
    When you want an easy way to do scrolling
    When you think that curses does more efficient drawing routines than terminal, and that matters to you
    When you want keypad
