When to use:
  You just want color/attributes, without dealing with the accursed curses
  You don't want to deal with the above mentioned accursed
  You want to use multiple terminals
  You need to do terminal-manipulations on files other than stdout
  You want unicode (py3k supports unicode)

When not to use:
  When you've got to support non-typical terminals (konsole is what I devel on)
  When you want to have multiple documents in a single window, and you want scrolling. (Perhaps scrolling in general? I guess at this)

The Modules:
  escape.py
    Various escape sequences. Use to set text attributes.
  lineread.py
    To get a line of input, like a non-blocking readline. Has a shoddy history buffer that can be disabled.
  window.py
    Code for creating new terminal window.
  drawing.py
    To only write out changes. (for roguelikes)
  coms.py
    Terminal configuration
  keys.py
    Intepret key codes
