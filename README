When to use:
  You don't want to deal with the acurrsed curses.
  You've got multiple terminal windows running around
  You just want color/attributes

When not to use:
  When you've got to support non-typical terminals
  If want output to be optimized (I guess? Doesn't curses optimize that sort of thing?)
  

Not much documentation in the library. You'll see a bunch of stuff, yeah? You can just print them out.
