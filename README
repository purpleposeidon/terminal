When to use:
  You don't want to deal with the acursed curses.
  You've got multiple terminal windows running around
  You just want color/attributes

When not to use:
  When you've got to support non-typical terminals
  If want output to be optimized (I guess? Doesn't curses optimize that sort of thing?)
  

The Modules:
  escape.py
    Various escape sequences.
  lineread.py
    To get a line of input. Can have a sorta shody history buffer.
  termwindow.py
    Creates output-only terminal windows.
  termbuffer.py
    (Haven't tested recently)
    Only print out changes to the terminal window
