This is a gentle-tongued

When to use:
  You think using curses is a pain in the ...bum
  You just want color/attributes, without dealing with the accursed curses
  You find the use of the above mentioned accursed to be a pain in the tushie
  You want to use multiple terminals
  You need to do terminal-manipulations on files other than stdout
  You want unicode (If unicode is all you want, consider also py3k, which supports unicode and curses)
  You think that curses' key system leaves something to be desired
  You trust that terminal will let you see tracebacks AND keep your terminal sane


When not to use:
  When you've got to support non-typical terminals (I develop under konsole)
  When you want to have multiple documents in a single window, and you want scrolling.
    (Perhaps scrolling in general? This offers nothing for scrolling terminals, but curses does)
  When you think that curses does more efficient drawing routines than terminal, and that matters to you
  When you want keypad
