When to use:
  You just want color/attributes, without dealing with the accursed curses
  You find the use of the above mentioned accursed to be a pain in the tushie
  You want to use multiple terminals
  You need to do terminal-manipulations on files other than stdout
  You want unicode (py3k's curses supports unicode)
  You don't want to mess with funky keys

When not to use:
  When you've got to support non-typical terminals (konsole is what I devel on)
  When you want to have multiple documents in a single window, and you want scrolling. (Perhaps scrolling in general? I guess at this)
  When you think that curses does more efficient drawing than terminal, and that matters to you
